            <h1>Sierra Cybernetics Inc.</h1>
            <p>
              Sierra Cybernetics was founded in 1981 to provide software
              engineering for the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army. Today, we
              provide complete information technology services for federal,
              state, and local government agencies.
            </p>
            <h2>Sierra’s core competencies focus on:</h2>

            <p>
              Throughout our history, Sierra has provided quality systems and
              software engineering support to nearly 20 separate DoD agencies,
              supporting programs such as EPLRS, JTRS, JTIDS, MK-92, JCDX, and
              Po Sheng. Systems developed by Sierra, or for which Sierra has
              had a significant development role, are currently deployed in
              Marine Corps, Army, and Navy commands, providing leading-edge
              technology.

            <p>
              Over 95% of our current defense work stems from previous
              customers. In the early 1990s, Sierra began to complement our DoD
              work by applying our information technology expertise into local
              government markets. We acquired one of California’s leading
              document imaging integrators in 1995, driving us to become a
              significant provider of client/server and web-based document
              imaging systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              We specialize in data capture, document management, and data
              analysis services. We hold California Master Services Agreements
              for information and imaging technology solutions and several IT
              service contracts with local government agencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sierra presents a broad experience base in leading-edge
              technology. Our engineering staff has current experience in
              networked systems, communications, and information processing,
              developing client/server and Web-based systems under Windows and
              UNIX. We have developed over 3,000,000 lines of code in C, C++,
              C#, ASP, .NET, Java, Perl, VB, Fortran, Ada, and PowerBuilder,
              using SharePoint, Oracle, Sybase, Ingres, SQL Server, and ODBC
              interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sierra employs strong systems and software engineering
              methodologies using structured, spiral, and object-oriented
              processes. We can provide project monitoring services utilizing
              personnel experienced in DoD, IEEE, SEI, CMMI, DRII, and ACP
              standards. We offer technical support services for risk
              management, software quality assurance, technical writing,
              testing, configuration management, and verification and
              validation.
